## What is BrowniePHP?

[BrowniePHP](http://browniephp.org) is a plugin for the [CakePHP framework](http://cakephp.org) that saves you the work to create a back-end for your app. With minimal configuration, the plugin adapts itself to any CakePHP application and automatically provides you a very intuitive and easy to use admin panel.

Developers familiarized with CakePHP might see it as an advanced ready-to-deploy [scaffolding](http://book.cakephp.org/view/1103/Scaffolding) system.

## Is BrowniePHP a CMS?

Yes, you could say so, but we prefer to say that BrowniePHP is a meta-framework; some kind of high-level framework built upon CakePHP that makes your development more agile, giving you an automatic content management system and some tools for the creation of front-ends.

## What is the difference between BrowniePHP and other popular CMS like Drupal, Joomla and Wordpress?

Most CMS in the market can be deployed and used turnkey, you only have to run the installer and a few steps ahead you are ready to use them. BrowniePHP is a CakePHP plugin and it works based in the [models](http://book.cakephp.org/view/1000/Models) you create for your application. That means: BrowniePHP by itself is useless, you have to create an app to give it life.

## Who is BrowniePHP for?
